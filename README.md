## 🧰 Prerequisites

- A Podbean account with API access (free or paid - they're all welcome)
- Podbean API credentials (Client ID and Secret - your magical keys to the kingdom)

## 🚀 Installation

### Installing via Smithery

To install Podbean Podcast Manager for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@amurshak/podbeanmcp):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @amurshak/podbeanmcp --client claude
```

1. Grab the code:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd PodbeanMCP
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment using the super-speedy `uv` tool:
   ```bash
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the package and its dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Using uv (faster)
   uv pip install -e .
   ```

   Or if you prefer traditional pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```
   
   This will install all dependencies from the pyproject.toml file, including:
   - mcp[cli] (MCP SDK)
   - httpx (for API requests)
   - python-dotenv (for environment variables)
   - pydantic (for data validation)

4. Create a `.env` file with your secret Podbean powers:
   ```
   PODBEAN_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   PODBEAN_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   ```

## 📝 Configuring in cline_mcp_settings.json

The recommended way to use this MCP server is to configure it directly in your cline_mcp_settings.json file. This allows the Cline IDE MCP Client to automatically start the server when needed.

1. Locate your cline_mcp_settings.json file. This file is used by Cline IDE to configure MCP servers. Refer to the Cline IDE documentation for the exact location of this file on your system.

2. Add the Podbean MCP server configuration to the "mcpServers" object:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Podbean MCP": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "mcp[cli]",
        "mcp",
        "run",
        "/full/path/to/PodbeanMCP/server.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PODBEAN_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id",
        "PODBEAN_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_client_secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. Customize the configuration:
   - Replace `/full/path/to/PodbeanMCP/server.py` with the absolute path to your server.py file
   - Replace `your_client_id` and `your_client_secret` with your Podbean API credentials from your .env file
   - If you're not using `uv`, adjust the command and args accordingly

4. Save the file and restart Cline IDE

> **Important Note**: You do not need to manually run the server with `python server.py` when using this configuration. Cline IDE will automatically start the server when needed and Claude (the AI) will be able to access it.

### Example with Multiple Servers

If you already have other MCP servers in your config, simply add the Podbean MCP server as a new entry:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Some Other MCP": {
      "command": "...",
      "args": [
        "..."
      ]
    },
    "Podbean MCP": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "mcp[cli]",
        "mcp",
        "run",
        "/full/path/to/PodbeanMCP/server.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PODBEAN_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id",
        "PODBEAN_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_client_secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Installation

After configuring the MCP server in your cline_mcp_settings.json file, you can test if it's working properly by asking Claude to use one of the Podbean MCP tools:

1. **Authenticate with Podbean**:
   ```
   Can you authenticate with my Podbean account using the Podbean MCP server?
   ```

2. **List your podcasts**:
   ```
   Can you list my podcasts using the Podbean MCP server?
   ```

3. **Get episodes for a specific podcast**:
   ```
   Can you get the episodes for my podcast with ID "your_podcast_id" using the Podbean MCP server?
   ```

If Claude successfully executes these commands and returns the expected results, your Podbean MCP server is working correctly!
